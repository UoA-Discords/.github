<h3 align="center">UoA Discords is a project to make Discord servers for the University of Auckland more accessible.</h3>
<br/>
<p align="center">
By grouping and categorizing all UoA servers in one place, students can find, share, and promote their communities with ease. Anyone can submit their UoA related server to be added to the website, using nothing more than their existing Discord account. Servers are vetted before being added to the site. <br/><br/></p>
